# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a standalone macOS application that monitors for double Command key taps and performs text-to-speech on selected text. The application will leverage the existing TTS model from the current project to provide immediate audio playback of selected text without requiring any server setup or complex configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want to double-tap the Command key to trigger text-to-speech on my currently selected text, so that I can quickly hear any text read aloud without interrupting my workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user double-taps the Command key within 500ms THEN the system SHALL detect this as a hotkey trigger
2. WHEN the hotkey is triggered AND text is currently selected on screen THEN the system SHALL capture the selected text
3. WHEN text is captured THEN the system SHALL immediately process it through the TTS model and play the generated audio
4. WHEN no text is selected AND the hotkey is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide a brief audio notification indicating no text was selected

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be a simple standalone script that can be run without complex setup, so that any developer can easily use it on their macOS system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is started THEN it SHALL run as a background process monitoring for the hotkey
2. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL load the TTS model and voice pack automatically
3. WHEN the application encounters missing dependencies THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages with installation instructions
4. WHEN the application is running THEN it SHALL consume minimal system resources while idle
5. WHEN the application is terminated THEN it SHALL clean up all resources and stop monitoring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a macOS user, I want the application to work with any text selection across all applications, so that I can use TTS functionality system-wide.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN text is selected in any macOS application THEN the system SHALL be able to capture that text via clipboard
2. WHEN the TTS audio is playing THEN the user SHALL be able to continue working in other applications
3. WHEN new TTS is triggered while audio is playing THEN the system SHALL stop the current audio and start the new one
4. WHEN the system lacks accessibility permissions THEN it SHALL prompt the user to grant necessary permissions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate audio feedback when I trigger the TTS function, so that I know the system is responding to my input.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the hotkey is detected THEN the system SHALL provide audio feedback within 100ms
2. WHEN TTS processing begins THEN the system SHALL play the generated audio immediately upon completion
3. WHEN TTS processing fails THEN the system SHALL play an error sound to indicate the failure
4. WHEN the selected text is too long THEN the system SHALL truncate it appropriately and still provide audio output

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to use the kokoro-demo-app.py approach for TTS processing, so that I get the most efficient and reliable audio generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application initializes THEN it SHALL load KModel instances for available devices (CPU/GPU)
2. WHEN the application initializes THEN it SHALL create KPipeline instances for supported languages
3. WHEN processing text THEN the system SHALL use the pipeline approach with automatic voice pack loading
4. WHEN generating audio THEN the system SHALL produce WAV format audio at 24kHz sample rate
5. WHEN the model files are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which files are required
